### Stack
- Python 3.12
- Tornado
- aiosqlite

### DB choice reasoning
this is a small project so a small bd like sqlight would be my choice if it wasn't for the asyncronous nature of the project this is why I choose aiosqlite that gives me the fast lightweight db with the async nature of the project.
